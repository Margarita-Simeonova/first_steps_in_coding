# Lesson "First steps in coding - Lab"


### Tasks:

1. Hello SoftUni:
    Print Hello SoftUni

########

2. Nums 1...10:
    Write a Python console program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 on separate lines to the console.

########

3. Rectangle Area:
Write a console program that inputs an integer 'a' and calculates the area of a square with side 'a'.

########

4. Inches to Centimeters:
Write a program that reads from the console a number (real) and converts the number from inches to centimeters. To do this, multiply the inches by 2.54 (because 1 inch = 2.54 centimeters).

########

5. Greeting by Name:

########

7. Projects Creation:
Write a program that calculates how many hours it will take an architect to prepare the designs of several construction sites. It takes three hours to prepare one project.

Input:

2 lines are read from the console:

1. The name of the architect - text;

2. Number of projects – integer.

########

8. Pet Shop:
Write a program that calculates the costs needed to buy food for dogs and other animals. One pack of dog food is priced at BGN 2.50, and each other that is not for them costs BGN 4.

Input:

2 lines are read from the console:

1. The number of dogs - integer number;

2. The number of remaining animals - a integer number.

Output:

The console prints:

"{final amount} lv."

########

9. Landscaping of yards

Bozhidara has several houses on the Black Sea and wants to landscape the yards of some of them, thus creating a cozy atmosphere and comfort for his guests. For this purpose, she hired a company.

Write a program that calculates the necessary funds that Bozhidara will have to pay to the company executing the project. The price per square meter is BGN 7.61 including VAT. Since her yard is quite large, the contractor offers an 18% discount on the final price.

Input:

Only one line is read from the console:

1. Sq. meters that will be landscaped - a real number.

Output:

Two lines are printed to the console:

· "The final price is: {final price of the service} lv."

· "The discount is: {discount} lv."

1. Console converter:

Write a program to convert US dollars () to Bulgarian leva ().

Use a fixed exchange rate between the dollar and the lev: 1 = 1.79549.

########

2. Console converter:
   
From radians to degrees Write a program that reads an angle in radians () and converts it to degrees (). Print the resulting degrees as an integer using math.floor

########

3. Calculator deposits

Write a program that calculates how much you will receive at the end of the deposit period at a given interest rate. Use the following formula:

amount = deposited amount + term of the deposit * ((deposited amount * annual interest rate ) / 12)

Input:

3 lines are read from the console:

1. Amount deposited – real number;

2. Term of the deposit (in months) – whole number;

3. Annual interest rate – real number;

Output:

To print the amount at the end of the term on the console.

Use the formula: degrees = radians * 180 / pi. The number in can be accessed via the module. To use its functionality, you must first turn on the constata.

4. Mandatory literature:
   
There are a number of books on Joro's must-read list for summer vacation. Since Joro prefers to play with friends outside, your task is to help him calculate how many hours a day he should spend to read the necessary literature

Input:
3 lines are read from the console:
 1. Number of pages in the current book - an integer in the range [1…1000]
 2. Pages read in 1 hour - an integer in the range [1…1000]
 3. The number of days for which he should read the book - an integer in the range [1…1000]
